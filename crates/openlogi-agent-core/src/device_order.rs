//! Canonical device ordering shared by the GUI carousel and the agent's
//! no-selection fallback.
//!
//! HID enumeration order shifts as devices wake, sleep, or are reselected, so
//! both processes order devices by a stable, route-derived identity instead.
//! Sharing the key here is what keeps them agreeing on "the first device": when
//! no `selected_device` is persisted, the GUI shows index 0 of its sorted list
//! and the agent targets index 0 of its own — they must be the same device.
